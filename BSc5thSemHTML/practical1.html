    <h1 >About</h1><br>
  <p> Department of Computer Science of the College was started in 1995 with Ms. Jyoti Vashisth as the founder head of the department. As per the govt. policy and University norms, the subject was introduced in self-finance and continues to be so. Prof. Kamal Gupta joined the department in 1997 till May 2012, when he moved to Govt. College cadre through HPSC. Dr. Pardeep Mittal, eminent academician and currently Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra also served the College and Dept. in its beginnings. In 21st century, the teaching learning of the subject has been universalized in all classes and streams of institution. The department currently offers UG programs as BCA and B.Sc in Computer Science and PG Diploma in Computer Applications. During its initial phase, the Dept. organized special training in Computer literacy for teaching and non-teaching staff, a major step that helped smooth transition to technology-savvy work force and culture with changing times. Carrying forward this tradition, Faculty of Dept. still pays an active and pivotal role in upgrading soft skills of the students as well as non-teaching support staff. </p>
